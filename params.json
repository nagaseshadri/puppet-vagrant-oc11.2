The Software listed above are all available [here](http://ppl.ug/LPZQYuf_xMI/) including the basebox \r\n- Download the base box (an Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.6 OS) for Vagrant manually from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f5jk8tym60efisp/oel66.box?dl=0)(if not done already) and add it to vagrant boxes list using the following command\r\n```\r\nvagrant box add --name <<name>> <<path to the box file>>\r\n```\r\n- Make a copy of the [vagrant_config.tmp.yaml ](./vagrant_config.tmp.yaml) to create a vagrant_config.yaml ( This file is not checkedin to avoid merge issues - the tmp is only a reference file, the Vagrant config is looking for a file named vagrant_config.yaml ) and edit it according to your setup / needs\r\n- Start the VM by running the following command from Terminal or Command prompt, this will try and import the base box and run provision to install the software needed - You can decide and update what to install by updating the classes section in [common.yaml](./hieradata/nodes/local/common.yaml)\r\n```\r\nvagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Whats in the box ?\r\n\r\n- The vagrant box (oel66.box) comes with git and puppet preinstalled.\r\n- Its configured to have a disk that cab expan upto 60GB, which should be sufficient for most of the development purposes.\r\n\r\n## Planned for future\r\n\r\n- Support for JBoss EAP\r\n- Installing Commerce Reference Store 11.1\r\n\r\n## References / Appendix\r\n\r\n- Want to know more about **Vagrant**?
